<h1>CamoBot</h1>
<p>A French Discord Bot developed with DiscordJS@13 for the guild <a href="https://is.gd/milleka">Milleka</a>
<hr />
<h2>What is the purpose of this project ?</h2>
<p>I developed a multipurpose Discord Bot for Camille#9466 (with general, utils, fun and some moderation commadns) with DiscordJS using NodeJS. The reach of this project was to learn how to code a Discord Bot since I use this application since a while, I thought it would be cool to understand event handling and use my JS knowledge to replacce some of the bots we had on the guild with only one.</p>

<h2>How to setup locally ?</h2>
<p>Feel free to clone the repository and change the informations on the file config.json and run your bot, it's open sourced for an educational purpose, and the bot will not be multi-guild.</p>

<h2>How to help ?</h2>
<p>You can fork, star or search for typos and open PRs, always appreciated</p>
